BitDevs is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion will be technical.

Our Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion.

[@niftynei](https://twitter.com/niftynei) will hold a presentation for BitDevs Oslo on June 3rd, coinciding with the start of [Oslo Freedom Forum 2024](https://oslofreedomforum.com/) (June 3-5) by the [Human Rights Foundation](https://hrf.org/).

Let us know whether you're attending, so we can get the right amount of snacks. Either directly here on meetup, or by sending a DM to Bare Bitcoin on the bird app.

Welcome.
