We invite all aspiring and experienced bitcoin developers to this group's first meetup! ü•≥

Attendance is free, but please sign up! Here, or by sending a DM to [@barebitcoin](https://x.com/barebitcoin) on Twitter.

Bring your PC, Mac, or Linux beast if you want to show something or need help getting started with cool bitcoin things.

Program:
- Espen with "Payment Terminals, Bolt Cards and Rings"
- Bj√∏rn Olav with "Drivechain"
- Andreas from [Schj√∏nhaug AS](https://www.schjonhaug.com) with [Tap Cards](https://github.com/schjonhaug/tapcards) - a Go implementation of the [Satscard](https://satscard.com) protocol

Let us know if you also have something you'd like to talk about! If we can't find space this time, we'll make it happen next time.

You are of course warmly welcome even if you're not a developer, but the program will have a technical focus.
