We invite all aspiring and experienced bitcoin developers to this group's second meetup!

Attendance is free, but please sign up! Here, or by sending a DM to [@barebitcoin](https://x.com/barebitcoin) on Twitter.

Bring your PC, Mac, or Linux beast if you want to show something or need help getting started with cool bitcoin things.

Program:
- [@octobocto](https://github.com/octobocto) with "Drivechains"
- [@ubbabeck](https://github.com/ubbabeck) with a presentation and discussion about Covenants

You are of course warmly welcome even if you're not a developer, but the program will have a technical focus.
